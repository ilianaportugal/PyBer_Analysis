# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze ride-sharing data by city type. Within this analysis are recommendations for how decision makers can respond to differences in the data.

## Results
### Total Rides
The total rides of urban cities is 1,625, this is the largest amount of all the cities. The total rides for suburban cities is 625 and 125 for rural cities.

### Total Drivers
Urban cities have the largest value for total drivers, 2,405, this is aligned with urban cities also having the highest amount of rides. Urban cities is the only city type whose total drivers outnumber their total rides by almost double. Both Suburban and Urban cities have less total drivers than total rides, 490 and 78 respectively.

### Total Fares
Urban cities have the highest total fares, $39,854.38. The urban cities fare total is more than double the total fares for Suburban cities, which is $19,356.33. In comparison the urban and suburban cities, rural cities have an extremely low sum of $4,327.93.

### Average Fare per Ride and Driver 
The average fare per ride and average fare per driver are positively correlated. Rural cities have the highest averages in $USD for both. Urban cities have the lowest averages.

### Total Fare by City Type
When comparing the total fare by city type from January 2019 to April 2019 Urban cities had the greatest sum of fares, followed by Suburban cities and then Rural cities. All cities experienced a slight peak towards the end of February.

## Summary

### Recommendation 1
Offer incentives for drivers in urban cities to do trips in suburban and rural cities.

### Recommendation 2
Decrease the price for rural fares in order to encourage more rides.

### Recommendation 3
Offer promos during weeks with low fare totals.
